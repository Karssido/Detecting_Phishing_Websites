### Phishing is an illegitimate method to collect secret information of any person or organization. Information like debit card, credit card details, PIN no, OTP, passwords, etc. are stolen by the attackers through phishing sites. Researchers have used different techniques to detect those phishing sites. But it is difficult to stay on a particular technique as attackers come with new tactics. In this paper, phishing and legitimate URL classifications are performed based on the lexical features of URLs. To evaluate the performance of our system, we have taken 30 features from URL to detect a website as a phishing or non-phishing. The system is trained using more than 11,055 phishing and legitimate URLs with XG-Boost classifier. Our experiment results show more than 97.47% accuracy in detecting phishing websites using XG-Boost Classifier.
